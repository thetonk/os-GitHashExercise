# Operating Systems - Git Hashing Exercise

This repo contains my very simple bash script for obtaining the SHA-256 checksum of a 4 digit number. In order to test it, you must provide first with execution permission like so:

``` sh
$ chmod +x hash_script.sh
```

### Example usage

``` sh
$ ./hash_output.sh <your 4 digit number here>
```
